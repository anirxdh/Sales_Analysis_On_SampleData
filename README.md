# Sales_Analysis_On_SampleData
I found this Data set on Github and did some analysis.
Summary:
-The Analysis graph tells us that when the price is more people tend to buy them less and vice versa.
-During the December Month , people tend to buy alot. It maybe due to holiday season.
-California is where most of the sale happens and Portland has the least.
-During 7pm most have the people order so we can direct advertisement during that time.
